CRUD in Next.js Using Zod, Shadcn, Prisma, Mongodb and SWR.

### Setup
1. Install dependencies.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your database url.
3. Run `npm prisma db push` to push changes to db and generate prisma client.
4. Todo CRUD should be working now.

This app is a very basic example implementing CRUD app in next.js. There are many thing that can be improved, but that is not the purpose of this repo. It's just to teach basic stuff, lol.
